  <p>Allows a calling app to continue a call which was started in another app.  An example is a
 video calling app that wants to continue a voice call on the user's mobile network.<p>
 When the handover of a call from one app to another takes place, there are two devices
 which are involved in the handover; the initiating and receiving devices.  The initiating
 device is where the request to handover the call was started, and the receiving device is
 where the handover request is confirmed by the other party.<p>
 This permission protects access to the
 <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/telecom/TelecomManager#acceptHandover(android.net.Uri,%20int,%20android.telecom.PhoneAccountHandle)">TelecomManager.acceptHandover(Uri, int, PhoneAccountHandle)</a></code> which
 the receiving side of the handover uses to accept a handover.
 <p>Protection level: dangerous</p></p>

    
      <p>Constant Value:
      
          "android.permission.ACCEPT_HANDOVER"
